    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",

    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",

    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",

    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out the definitions of three core concepts related to Large Language Models (LLMs): what they are like, how neural networks work, and what attention is and how it relates to Transformers. Hmm, where do I start?\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the basic structure of an LLM, I think LLMs are big models that can generate or understand human language. They're trained on vast amounts of text data, right? So, they must have layers that process information. I remember something about a sequence model—that's common with sequence-based models. Maybe it has multiple sub-layers processing different parts of the input.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to neural networks, since LLMs are part of AI and ML approaches, they probably use神经网络 (\"neural network\") concepts. There's an encoder-decoder architecture where each step processes different parts of the input text—maybe encoding in one module and decoding another? I think backpropagation is used for learning from examples, so that's crucial for training these models.\n",
      "\n",
      "For attention and transformers, attention must be key in LLMs because it allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input. I recall something about position vectors and how each token's perspective matters during interaction. Oh right! It uses scaled dot-product attention where models pay more attention if tokens seem important together. The key is that this creates multiple attention layers, allowing different aspects of the input to influence the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together: an LLM's core structure includes a sequence model with encoders and decoders, each handling specific text tasks. During training, backpropagation adjusts parameters based on data examples. Attention functions make models focus on relevant text segments, and transformers enable multiple attention layers for nuanced interactions. This setup allows the model to process language beyond what single-layer networks can handle.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) are sophisticated AI systems designed to generate or understand human language. Their core structure consists of a sequence model that processes input text by encoding one part of it and decoding another, using an encoder-decoder architecture with backpropagation for training.\n",
